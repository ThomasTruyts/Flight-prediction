# Flight Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting flight prices using a machine learning model. The process involves scraping flight data from a website, performing feature engineering, and training a Random Forest Regressor to make price predictions.

## Data Collection

Flight data is scraped from a website using web scraping techniques. The data includes various features such as departure city, arrival city, departure date, arrival date, airline, and other relevant information. By collecting a substantial amount of flight data, we aim to capture patterns and trends that influence flight prices.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering plays a crucial role in developing an effective machine learning model. In this project, several feature engineering techniques are employed to enhance the predictive power of the model. Some of these techniques include:

- **Date-Time Feature Extraction**: Extracting meaningful information from the date and time fields, such as day of the week, month, hour, or any other relevant features that can capture seasonality or time-related patterns.

- **Categorical Feature Encoding**: Converting categorical features, such as airlines or departure/arrival cities, into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. This allows the model to interpret and utilize categorical data effectively.

- **Feature Scaling**: Scaling numerical features to a common scale, such as using standardization or normalization, to ensure that no single feature dominates the model's learning process.

These feature engineering techniques help to transform the raw flight data into a suitable format for training the machine learning model.

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model used in this project is the Random Forest Regressor. Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. In the case of regression tasks, such as predicting flight prices, Random Forest Regressor proves to be effective in capturing complex relationships between features and the target variable.

## Model Evaluation and Performance

The trained Random Forest Regressor model is evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared. These metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and ability to generalize to unseen flight data.
